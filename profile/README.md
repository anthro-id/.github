Welcome to **anthro.id** official GitHub profile!

It is a place where you can find reliable sources of anthropomorphic-related stuff including articles, conventions, talents, and more in the future!

# 😎 For nerds
Let’s face it — a lot of furries (in Indonesia and worldwide) are [huge nerds](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry/comments/1b7z2su/why_is_such_a_huge_number_of_furries_into_stem/)!

We made this GitHub profile to show off our nerdy side — and maybe inspire you to create something even cooler!

# 🍀 Ecosystem
We use GitHub to store public data (such as logos and datasets), policy changes (like our terms of use), and more!

This is our way of ensuring fairness and transparency between you (as part of the furry community!) and us (as a platform).

# ✍️ What's Next?
Check out our [public roadmap (Trello)](https://redirect.anthro.id/roadmap) to see what we're building next!

# 📚 Stacks
While we can't open-source the platform, we can show you how we built it!

**Anthro.id** is built using powerful technologies and tools, such as:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to build everything from the ground up! It’s powerful, scalable, and lets us handle both frontend and backend without the need for a separate app.
- [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) to store static content such as article banner, profile pictures.
- ... and more!
