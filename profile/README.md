# Overview
Welcome to **anthro.id** official GitHub profile.

It is a place where you can find reliable sources of anthropomorphic-related stuff including articles, conventions, talents, 
and more in the future.

We created this GitHub organization account to publish our stuff and show it to public, from legal terms to small open source tools.

# Tools
While we can't open-source the platform, but we built this platform using powerful technologies such as:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to transform and power our website.
  - We also let [Mantine](https://mantine.dev) to handle components such as buttons, menus, and more.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) with [uWebsockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) on top to deliver APIs faster.
- utilizing [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) mainly for security and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) to power our databases and distribute public contents worldwide.

# Resources
- [Legal](https://github.com/anthro-id/legal) - An extensive list of policies around our platform.
- [Platform Changelog](https://github.com/anthro-id/changelog) - A changelog: a history of all the changes and improvements we've made to the platform.
- [Datasets](https://github.com/anthro-id/datasets) - A public-domain datasets that we used for our platform, such as country codes list.

We may open-source our tools to empower our apps; you can check that by visiting our [npmjs.com profile](https://www.npmjs.com/~anthro.id).
